## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()

The control group consistantly had lower scores than the experimental
group. The experimental group seemed to score higher over time, whereas
the control group stayed relatively level.

## Problem 3

``` r
sim_mean_p = function(mu) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    samp = rnorm(30, mean = mu, sd = 5),)
  
   t.test(pull(sim_data, samp), mu=0) %>%
      broom::tidy() %>%
      mutate(reject= (p.value < .05)) %>%
     select( estimate, p.value, reject)
}
sim_mean_p(0)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   estimate p.value reject
    ##      <dbl>   <dbl> <lgl> 
    ## 1    0.412   0.629 FALSE

``` r
sim_result = 
  tibble(mus = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = mus, ~rerun(5000, sim_mean_p(mu = .x))),
    estimates = map(output_lists, bind_rows)) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimates)
```

Plots

``` r
sim_result %>% 
  group_by(mus) %>%
  summarise(chance_reject = mean(reject)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= mus, y= chance_reject)) +
  geom_col()
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

<img src="p8105_hw5_ark2187_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
avg = sim_result %>% 
  group_by(mus) %>%
  summarise(avg_mean = mean(estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= mus, y= avg_mean)) +
  geom_col()
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
avg_r = sim_result %>% 
  filter(reject == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(mus) %>%
  summarise(avg_mean = mean(estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= mus, y= avg_mean)) +
  geom_col()
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
#avg_r + avg
```

``` r
all_data = sim_result %>% 
  group_by(mus) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= mus, y= estimate, group = mus)) +
  geom_boxplot()

rejected = sim_result %>% 
  filter(reject == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(mus) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= mus, y= estimate, group = mus)) +
  geom_boxplot()

#all_data + rejected
```

For mus that are lower, the mean estimate of the samples that reject the
null hypothesis are higher than the mean of all the samples. The higher
means are farther from 0, and therefore more likely to be rejected.
